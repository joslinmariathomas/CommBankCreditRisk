## Credit Risk Data Preprocessing Pipeline
#### Data cleaning and feature engineering pipeline for credit application data, for credit risk modeling workflow.

### Overview
- The dataset used is from [Kaggle Home Credit Risk ](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/rules)
- Restricted to `application_train` dataset given the time constraints.
  - One row represents one loan from the data sample.
- Tackles real world challenges in credit data preprocessing:
  - High Missing data of some fields - housing data for this dataset
  - Careful Data imputation for missing and for absurd/wrong values.
  - Feature engineering relevant to credit risk.
